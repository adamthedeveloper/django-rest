This script is intended to add RESTful actions and templates to your django application.  I admit, this is sort of RAILS-ish - but I like it.  The following actions will be written to your application's views.py file:

index, new, create, edit, update, destroy, show

Also, matching templates will be created in your templates directory:

templates/<application name>/index.html
templates/<application name>/new.html
templates/<application name>/create.html
templates/<application name>/edit.html
templates/<application name>/update.html
templates/<application name>/destroy.html
templates/<application name>/show.html

This gives you an initial shell to work with.

INSTALLATION (Quick):

I use a MAC and to get this to run for me, I had to copy restview.py to:

/Library/Python/2.5/site-packages/django/core/management/commands/

Once you copy it to the similar place on your machine/environment, you should be able to go to your django project folder, create your application:

python manage.py startapp <application name>

and then to create the RESTful shell do:

python manage.py restview <application name>

HOW TO USE WITH SOME Handholding:

Step 1) Create a project

django-admin.py startproject loddydaa

Step 2) Create an application

cd loddyda
python manage.py startapp woopdydoo

Step 3) Run django-rest

python manage.py restview woopdydoo

If all goes well, you will see your views.py has been modified, a urls.py file was created and you have view templates created for each of the actions as well.

Make sure you have added the templates directory to your TEMPLATE_DIRS directive in settings.py.

And then add this to your project's url.py within the urlpatterns directive:

(r'^<application name here>/', include('<project name here>.<application name here>.urls')),




Thats it!
